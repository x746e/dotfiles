* Add README.
* Rewrite install script into python (e.g. see
  https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2044 for why it's not that a
  great idea to write shell scripts.)

== vim
* Syntax highlighting of SQL inside python files.  See how it was done for
  python inside vimscript.  Or for js inside html.
* In python don't highlight all code after " till the end as string.  See how
  it was done for vimscript.

* revamp vim config (something like oh-my-vim?)
* scrollbar with error/search/modified marks like in pycharm
* version control plugin
* do something with search highlights - they are annoying

* auto-saving, as in pycharm?

* store undo history between vim launches

* change tmux window title.


== zsh
* try oh-my-zsh

* zsh/tmux titles: use name of resumed job instead of `fg`.

=== prompt
* add start-time of the command
* when there are suspended jobs, show it somehow in the prompt
* display colored/signal-aware exit status in prompt; see the my_prompt
  function in ~meyering/.zshrc

=== zsh version-control-status in prompt
* add git status (similar to hg one)
* for version control status information in the prompt -- update it when
  something changes in the repo.
* take a look at for display version-control-agnostic state in prompt:
  /mnt/vol/engshare/admin/scripts/scm-prompt
* things to display:
** branch/bookmark name
** any files changed?
** any untracked files?
** is there some strange state, like in the middle of merge, rebase; any unmerged conflicts?
** is there stashed/shelved changes?
** some phabricator specific info?

=== editor
* regex replace in zle?
* `f` as in vim.
* edit current line in vim


== tmux
